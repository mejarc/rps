# Introduction:
#
# this file is all you need to create a database, setup that database,
# connect to it and interact with it using PostgresSQL (assuming you've
# already installed PostgreSQL and the server is running, of course)
#
# if you're not sure what this is about, just keep reading and try running
# this script, look at the output and think about what's happening.
#
# if you're already comfortable with all of this, good for you.  rejoice!
# ---------------------------------------
# ---------------------------------------

# first, choose to name your database.  SQLite databases live in one file:
# feel free to be creative.  this will be the name of your file
DATABASE_NAME = 'rpsls_data'

# require the gem pg.  You must type `gem install pg` at the command line
# if not, you'll get this error: `cannot load such file -- pg`
require 'pg'

# Faker makes fake data.  Same deal on the gem
require 'faker'

# you would usually create your postgresql database outside of Ruby
# using the command line or a rake task.
# or we can just do that for you right here.
ignore_errors = "/dev/null 2>&1" # this is a little helper for the line below
`createdb #{DATABASE_NAME} #{ignore_errors}`


# now that you have a database, set up a connection to it
db_connection = PG.connect( dbname: DATABASE_NAME )

# use the methods provided by the Database class in the gem to
# interact with the database


# ---------------------------------------
# cleanup (if we've run this more than once)
# ---------------------------------------

db_connection.exec("drop table if exists users;")
# read more about the connection object here:
# http://rubydoc.info/gems/pg/PG/Connection


# ---------------------------------------
# create the table we'll use later
# ---------------------------------------

# you don't need to use the word SQL below.  it's a "heredoc" (read about it) in Ruby
# that lets you declare multi-line string variables.  we use <<-SQL ... SQL  to specify
# the heredoc so that Sublime notices it and highlights the contents as SQL
db_connection.exec(<<-SQL
  create table users
  (

  labels = %w[fname lname company]
  fake_data = Hash[labels.map(&:to_sym).zip data.map{|d| d.gsub("'", "''")}]

  # it could have been this simple, for example.  the goal is to escape apostrophes
  # fn, ln, co = Faker::Name.first_name.gsub("'", "''"),
  #              Faker::Name.last_name.gsub("'", "''"),
  #              Faker::Company.bs.gsub("'", "''")
